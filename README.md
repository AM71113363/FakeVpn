●by default all apps will try to connect using the Vpn and they will get ignored,but the Apps in the whitelist will get excluded from the Vpn,for them the Vpn doesn't exist.<br>
●it handles only Dns requests on port 53,and ignores the other requests<br>

## How to use it <br>
●Select the Apps that you want to exclude from the Vpn.<br>
●After you click Start <VPN> ,the WhiteList will be saved,so the next time you don't have to select them again.<br>

# NOTE <br>
the app has internet permission just to get the local IP<br>
